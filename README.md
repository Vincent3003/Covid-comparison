# Compare COVID-19 in 3 different countries

This is my project for summer 2022. I will compare the total cases, the percentage of total average cases with the population, and the percentage of total average deaths from three different countries: China, the United States, and Vietnam.

It is an upgraded version of the Introduction to R & SAS final project. I implemented R coding program to clean, calculate, and make a multiple-line graph to compare different data. I picked three countries: China, the USA, and Vietnam. The reason why I chose China is where COVID-19 happened. The USA is the highest, and Vietnam is next to the border line of China. 


Total cases. R: this code calculates the total cases in three different countries by each quarter from 2020 to 2022
Percentage of total cases. R: this code calculates the percentage of total cases in three different countries by each quarter from 2020 to 2022
Percentage of total deaths. R: this code calculates the percentage of total deaths in three different countries by each quarter from 2020 to 202
