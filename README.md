# Covid-comparison

This is my personal project for this summer.

It is an upgraded version of STAT 040 final project. I implemented R coding program to clean, calculate, and make a multiple-line graph to compare different data. I picked three countries: China, USA, Vietnam. The reason why I picked Vietnam because China is where COVID-19 happened, USA is the highest, and Vietnam is next to the border line of China.
